# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The objective is to take the ecommerce database provided in csv files and analyze it in PostgreSQL software. 

## Process
### Step 1- Import data into PostgreSQL as the correct data type.
### Step 2- Understanding what each table means and what information are included in the tables. A schema is generated at this time for future references.
### Step 3- Look into the 'start with questions' file provided and refer back to the schema to see which table(s) may contain information required to answer the questions.
### Step 4- Perform data cleaning such as identifying duplicates or missing data and create a new table(view) as a clean dataset to refer to.
### Step 5- Analyze the data by using multiple queries to obtain answers to the questions.
### Step 6- Perform QA process by double checking if the results are conforming with expectations. 
### Step 7- Record each process.

## Results
The dataset is related to the website customer activity and the product movements and sales associate with it. 
Analysis on consumer demographics such as location and the channels that consumers are directed from can be done.
Additional analysis can be done on the products such as top-selling items.

## Challenges 
There seems to be overlaping information between different tables which makes it hard to decide where the results should come from. 
There are missing data in the tables which poses risks of completeness in data. The result may be different if all data is present.
Without clear instructions on who the users are for this analysis, it makes the analysis a bit scattered instead of focused on what could be useful in business decision making.

## Future Goals
I would like to compare the information that seems to exist in different tables and see if there are any differences. 
If so,I would like to see which one(s) is the more accurate one or understand what is causing the differences.
